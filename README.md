# Lingo Boom
Lingo Boom a language learning app developed by team DIScovery for the class Designing Interactive Systems at RWTH Aachen University.

The basic idea is to simplify learning articles and vocabulary for the German language by repetition. It is designed to allow quick sessions on your mobile device whenever there is a small time pocket.

It's designed for people like [Lizzy](Persona2-sherry.png) and [Tin Tin](Persona-sherry.png), who want to learn a language but not by sitting down and studying for hours.

##The concept
According to professionals we asked, articles are best learned by repeating words and matching them with the right article. The traditional approach used by a lot of students is to write them on paper and cover the article (or translation). Then the student tries to remember the article and check if he is right by uncovering.

Quite often students tend to get stuck on words and miss the learning goals. We want to simplify this process by creating an app that will challenge the user to remember the articles and words and require the user to go through the words as fast as possible.

In a lot of currently existing apps we noticed, that those fail to motivate the user and fail at teaching the user.

Take this negative example from the App Store, where we observed users to discover the problems with existing apps:

The user gets asked a word and has to select the correct article. The words are random. After tapping a word the user gets feedback wether he's right or wrong and gets a new word.

We observed these problems:

* Users get stuck at times when they don't know the correct article
* They spend much time for each word
* Wrong words don't reappear, small learning effect
* a lot of time between selecting one article and getting a new word (~ 2s)

In order to solve these different problems we decided to create a game. In a game it's intuitively possible to provide the user with feedback and to encourage the user not to spend to much time on each word. We want the user to mostly learn the articles subconsciously.
